WSL Setup: tested on Ubuntu 20

1. Install openocd.exe on your windows side, according to book's windows instructions. Add it to your path on windows side
2. Follow the necissary linux setup from the book. From what I remember, this should be just getting rust setup, downloading itm, and downloading multiarch-gdb. I *think* you can skip the minicom setup, too. I think we'll use putty.exe from windows instead.

3. source debug.sh in your ~/.bashrc (e.g. ". ~/discovery/debug.sh"):
     puts start-itm function in shell (for logging)
     puts start-openocd function in shell (for interfacing with board)
     updates "target remote <windows_ip_addr>:3333" in all openocd.gdb files with current value every time the file is run / sourced
4. download open-browser.sh and add "export BROWSER=~/pathto/open-browser.sh" to ~/.bashrc 
     allows cargo doc --open (or any Ubuntu command) to open files in windows browser

WSL Setup

1. Install openocd.exe on your windows side
2. Follow linux setup from the book (except for setup for openocd)

3. source two files in .bashrc:

   debug.sh
     puts start-itm function in shell (for logging)
     puts start-openocd function in shell (for interfacing with board)
     updates "target remote <windows_ip_addr>:3333" in all openocd.gdb files with current value

   open-browser.sh
     allows cargo doc --open (or any Ubuntu command) to open files in windows browser
